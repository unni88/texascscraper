# texascscraper

This is an python based Application that will Scrape all the downloadable video files from Texas Supreme Court(Civil) Website and create and HTML File with links to all the Videos for downloading them directly.
This information is public domain and should have been made easier to download directly anyway , but it seems they have used the service of a company which has hidden the source information in a dynamically generated source file and thus not making them accesible.
